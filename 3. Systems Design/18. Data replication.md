### What is Data replication 
Data replication is the process of creatin, updating and maintaining multiple copies of the same data to ensure data availability, reliability and fault tolerance 

#### Master-Slave replication 
The master database performs both read and write operations while the replication database serves only read operations. The master database is responsible for replicating the writes it receives to the slave databases. The slave dbs can also replicate to its own slave dbs in a nested or tree like format. 

If the master db is offline or out of operation the system is still able to perform read operations but can only execute writes if a slave db is promoted to master or a new master db is installed 

**Advantages:**
- Backups of the entire database of relatively no impact on the master.
- Applications can read from the slave(s) without impacting the master.
- Slaves can be taken offline and synced back to the master without any downtime.

**Disadvantages:**
- Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.
- Downtime and possibly loss of data when a master fails.
- All writes also have to be made to the master in a master-slave architecture.
- The more read slaves, the more we have to replicate, which will increase replication lag.
#### Master-Master replication 
Both master dbs perform write and read operations and replicate the writes they recieve to the other master db. If one of the master goes down the system is still up and running since the master db can execute both write and read

**Advantages:**
- Applications can read from both masters.
- Distributes write load across both master nodes.
- Simple, automatic, and quick failover.

**Disadvantages:**
- Not as simple as master-slave to configure and deploy.
- Either loosely consistent or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
- Conflict resolution comes into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.


#### Synchronous replication 

**Definition**: Synchronous replication ensures that data is written to the primary and secondary (replica) nodes at the same time. The primary node waits for an acknowledgment from the secondary node before confirming the write operation to the client.

 **Advantages:**
- **Data Consistency**: Guarantees that the data on the replica is always identical to the primary.
- **Zero Data Loss**: No risk of data loss because all transactions are committed to both nodes simultaneously.
- **High Availability**: Immediate failover with up-to-date data on the replica.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Performance Overhead**: Increased latency due to the need to wait for acknowledgment from the replica.
- **Network Dependency**: Performance is highly dependent on network speed and reliability.
- **Complexity**: More complex to set up and manage due to the need for tight coordination between nodes.
- **Errors:** If the replication fails in one of the secondary databases, the whole write process will fail, ack is required from all the secondary db's for a successful write operation

**Use cases:**
- **Financial Transactions**: Where data integrity and consistency are critical.
- **Inventory Management**: Systems that require real-time consistency across locations.
- **Enterprise Applications**: High-stakes applications where data loss cannot be tolerated.

#### Asynchronous replication 

**Definition**: Asynchronous replication allows the primary node to process write operations without waiting for the replica to acknowledge the write. The data is sent to the replica, but the primary does not wait for confirmation.

 **Advantages:**
- **Low Latency**: Write operations are faster because they do not wait for the replica.
- **Better Performance**: Less performance impact on the primary node.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale out with multiple replicas without impacting write performance.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Potential Data Loss**: In the event of a primary node failure, some recent data might not be replicated to the secondary.
- **Eventual Consistency**: The replica might lag behind the primary, leading to eventual consistency rather than immediate consistency.
- **Complex Recovery**: Recovery can be more complex if the primary node fails.

**Use cases:**
- **Web Applications**: Where low latency is important, and occasional data lag can be tolerated.
- **Data Warehousing**: Batch updates where immediate consistency is not critical.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Distribution of content where eventual consistency is acceptable.

#### ### Semi-Synchronous Replication

**Definition**: Semi-synchronous replication is a middle ground between synchronous and asynchronous replication. The primary node waits for an acknowledgment from at least one secondary node before confirming the write operation, but not necessarily from all replicas.

 **Advantages:**
- **Balanced Consistency and Performance**: Offers a trade-off between immediate consistency and performance.
- **Reduced Data Loss**: Lowers the risk of data loss compared to purely asynchronous replication.
- **Better Performance**: Reduces latency compared to synchronous replication since it does not wait for all replicas.

 **Disadvantages:**
- **Partial Data Consistency**: Not all replicas are guaranteed to have the latest data immediately.
- **Complexity**: More complex than asynchronous replication to implement and manage.
- **Potential Latency**: Higher latency than asynchronous replication, though lower than synchronous.

 **Use cases:**
- **E-commerce**: Balancing the need for data consistency with performance.
- **Online Banking**: Where reduced data loss is important but not at the cost of significant performance overhead.
- **Distributed Databases**: Systems requiring a balance between write performance and data safety.
