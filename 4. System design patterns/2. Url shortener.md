### Breakdown:

1. **41-bit Timestamp:**
    - **Resolution:** A 41-bit timestamp with millisecond precision gives you a time range of 2412^{41}241 milliseconds.
    - **Duration:** This can represent about 69 years, so it’s sufficient for long-term usage.
2. **1-bit Random Value:**
    - **Uniqueness:** A 1-bit random value gives you 2 possible values (0 or 1), effectively doubling the possible unique IDs for each millisecond.

#### Total Bit Length:

- **Total:** 41-bit timestamp + 1-bit random value = 42 bits.

#### Base62 Encoding:

- **42 Bits:** A 42-bit number can be fully encoded into a **7-character** Base62 string because 62762^7627 represents approximately 3.5 trillion unique combinations, which corresponds to 42 bits.

#### Feasibility for 100 Million Writes per Day:

- **Write Rate:** 100 million writes per day equals roughly 1,157 writes per second.
- **Millisecond Granularity:** With a 41-bit timestamp at millisecond granularity and a 1-bit random value, the system can handle up to 2 writes per millisecond, which is 2,000 writes per second.

Given this, the design is feasible as it comfortably supports 1,157 writes per second (or 100 million writes per day). The random 1-bit adds a small layer of uniqueness to handle any potential collisions within the same millisecond.

#### Conclusion:

Yes, using a 41-bit timestamp (to the millisecond) combined with a 1-bit random value is a feasible solution for generating unique IDs that can be encoded into a 7-character Base62 hash and support approximately 100 million write operations per day. This design should work efficiently for your distributed system.


### Generating a hashed 7 char unique ID using Time stamp 
#### Step 1: Generate a 41-bit Epoch Timestamp

- For this example, let's assume a 41-bit timestamp value.
    - Suppose our 41-bit timestamp value (in binary) is: `10101010101010101010101010101010101010101`
    - Converting this binary to decimal: `146464464645`

#### Step 2: Add a Random 1-Bit Value

- Let's append a random 1-bit value (either `0` or `1`). Suppose we choose `1`.
    - The 42-bit value (in binary) now is: `101010101010101010101010101010101010101011`
    - Converting this binary to decimal: `292928929291`

#### Step 3: Convert the 42-bit Decimal to Base62

- Base62 uses the characters `[a-z][A-Z][0-9]`, which gives us 62 possible values per character.
- To convert the decimal value `292928929291` to Base62:

#### Conversion Process

1. Divide the decimal number by 62 repeatedly, recording the remainder at each step. This remainder corresponds to the Base62 digit.
2. Map each remainder to the corresponding Base62 character.

Here is how it would look:

1. **292928929291 ÷ 62 = 4724637577**, remainder = `17` → `r`
2. **4724637577 ÷ 62 = 76139315**, remainder = `7` → `h`
3. **76139315 ÷ 62 = 1228053**, remainder = `41` → `P`
4. **1228053 ÷ 62 = 19807**, remainder = `39` → `N`
5. **19807 ÷ 62 = 319**, remainder = `49` → `X`
6. **319 ÷ 62 = 5**, remainder = `9` → `j`
7. **5 ÷ 62 = 0**, remainder = `5` → `f`

#### Step 4: Combine Base62 Characters

The Base62 characters obtained from the conversion are combined in reverse order:

- The 7-character Base62 representation is **"fjXNPhr"**.

#### Final Example:

- **41-bit timestamp + 1 random bit (42-bit value):** `101010101010101010101010101010101010101011`
- **Decimal representation:** `292928929291`
- **Base62 (7-character):** **"fjXNPhr"**

This is how a 42-bit unique ID (41-bit timestamp + 1-bit random) could be converted to a 7-character Base62 string using the characters `[a-z][A-Z][0-9]`.
