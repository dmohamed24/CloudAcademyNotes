When a host device sends a DNS query to the DNS server, the process involves several steps, including ARP requests for MAC addresses. Here's how it works:

 If it's the first time a device in a LAN is trying to resolve a domain name, it will use ARP to find the MAC address of the router. The router then forwards the DNS query to the DNS server

1. **Host Device Configures DNS**:
    
    - The host device is configured with the IP address of the DNS server, which is typically provided by the router via DHCP.
2. **Sending the DNS Query**:
    
    - When the host device (Host A) wants to resolve [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com), it prepares a DNS query packet.
    - The DNS query packet has the DNS server's IP address as the destination IP.
3. **ARP Request to Find DNS Server's MAC Address**:
    
    - If the host device does not have the MAC address of the DNS server (often the router's IP for DNS forwarding), it needs to find it using ARP.
    - Host A sends an ARP request to determine the MAC address corresponding to the DNS server's IP address (usually the router's IP address).
4. **ARP Response**:
    
    - The router (Router-0) responds with its MAC address.
    - Host A updates its ARP table with the router's MAC address associated with the DNS server's IP address.
5. **Sending DNS Query to Router**:
    
    - Host A sends the DNS query packet to the router using the router's MAC address.
6. **Router Forwards DNS Query**:
    
    - The router forwards the DNS query to the DNS server, typically located at the ISP.
7.  **DNS Server Receives the DNS Query**:
	- The DNS server, typically at the ISP, receives the DNS query from the router.
	- The DNS server checks its records to resolve the domain name (e.g., [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com)) to the corresponding IP address.
8.  **DNS Server Sends DNS Response**:
	- The DNS server creates a DNS response packet containing the resolved IP address of the requested domain (e.g., 31.13.65.1 for [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com)).
    - The DNS server sends this response back to the router's IP address.
9.  **Router Receives DNS Response**:
	- The router receives the DNS response from the DNS server.
    - The response packet includes:
	    - The resolved IP address of [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com).
	    - Source IP address: DNS server's IP address.
	    - Destination IP address: Host device A's IP address.
10.  **Router Forwards DNS Response to Host Device A**:
	- The router forwards the DNS response to Host device A.
	- The router uses the MAC address of Host device A (from its ARP table) to send the response packet.
11.  **Host Device A Receives DNS Response**:
	- Host device A receives the DNS response with the IP address of [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com).
	- Host device A updates its DNS cache with the IP address for [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com).
12.  **Host Device A Initiates Connection to [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com)**:
	- Now that Host device A has the IP address of [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com), it can initiate a connection.
	- Host device A creates a TCP connection request (e.g., a TCP SYN packet) to the IP address of [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com).
13.  **Packet Forwarding for Connection**:
	- Host device A sends the connection request packet to the router, which is the gateway to the internet.
	- The router forwards this packet to the Facebook server via the internet.


### Summary:

- **Host Device Sends DNS Query**: The host device sends a DNS query to the configured DNS server IP address.
- **ARP Request**: If the MAC address of the DNS server (usually the router) is not known, the host sends an ARP request.
- **ARP Response**: The router responds with its MAC address.
- **Forwarding DNS Query**: The host device sends the DNS query to the router, which then forwards it to the actual DNS server.
- **DNS Query Sent**: Host device A sends a DNS query to the router.
- **DNS Query Forwarded**: The router forwards the DNS query to the ISP's DNS server.
- **DNS Server Resolves Query**: The DNS server resolves the domain name to an IP address and sends the response back to the router.
- **DNS Response Forwarded**: The router forwards the DNS response to Host device A.
- **Host A Initiates Connection**: Host device A uses the resolved IP address to initiate a connection to [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com).
