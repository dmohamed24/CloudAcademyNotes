A router is a networking device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to forward data packets between different computer networks. 
### How it works 
Scenario: Device A communicating with a device outside its LAN a Facebook server. The following basic network setup
	- Host device A connected to Switch-1
	- Switch-1 is connected to Router-0 
	- Router-0 is connected to switch-2 
	- Switch-2 is connected to a single Facebook device a server

1. **Initiation**: Host device A wants to communicate with the Facebook server and knows its IP address but not its MAC address.
    
2. **ARP Request for Default Gateway**:
    - Device A realizes the Facebook server is outside its local network.
    - It needs the MAC address of its default gateway (Router-0) to send packets out of the LAN.
    - Device A creates an ARP request to find Router-0's MAC address, including:
        - Source MAC address: A's MAC address
        - Source IP address: A's IP address
        - Target IP address: Router-0's IP address
        - Target MAC address: set to all zeros
    
3. **Broadcast ARP Request**:
    - Device A broadcasts the ARP request.
    - Switch-1 receives the broadcast and forwards it to all its ports except the one it was received from.
    
4. **ARP Reply from Router-0**:
    - Router-0 receives the ARP request, recognizes its IP address, and responds with an ARP reply.
    - ARP reply includes:
        - Source MAC address: Router-0's MAC address
        - Source IP address: Router-0's IP address
        - Target IP address: A's IP address
        - Target MAC address: A's MAC address
    - Router-0 sends the ARP reply back to Host A.
    - Switch-1 forwards the unicast ARP reply to Host A.
    
5. **Updating ARP Table**:
    - Host A updates its ARP table with Router-0’s MAC address associated with its IP address.
    
6. **Packet Forwarding to Router-0**:
    - Host A encapsulates the data packet for the Facebook server with:
        - Destination IP: Facebook server’s IP address
        - Source IP: A's IP address
        - Destination MAC: Router-0's MAC address
        - Source MAC: A's MAC address
    - Host A sends the packet to Switch-1, which forwards it to Router-0.
    
7. **Routing to Facebook Server**:
    - If Router-0 does not have the mac-address of the Facebook server then it will go through the ARP flooding process to identify it  
    - Router-0 receives the packet, checks its routing table, and determines it needs to send the packet to Switch-2 to reach the Facebook server.
    - Router-0 encapsulates the packet with:
        - New Source MAC: Router-0's MAC address
        - New Destination MAC: Facebook server’s MAC address
    - Router-0 forwards the packet to Switch-2.
    
8. **Forwarding to Facebook Server**:
    - Switch-2 receives the packet and forwards it to the Facebook server based on its MAC address.
    
9. **Communication with Facebook Server**:
    - The Facebook server receives the packet, processes it, and can send a response back to Host A.
    - The response packet follows the reverse path, using the MAC addresses to route back through Switch-2, Router-0, and Switch-1 to Host A.

In summary, Host A uses ARP to find the MAC address of its default gateway (Router-0), sends the packet to Router-0, which then routes the packet to Switch-2 and finally to the Facebook server.

##### Response Message process 
When Facebook sends a response message back to Host device A, here's how the process typically works regarding MAC addresses:

1. **Response Packet from Facebook Server**:
    - The Facebook server sends a response packet back to Host device A.
    - This response packet will have:
        - Source IP address: Facebook server's IP address
        - Destination IP address: Host device A's IP address
        - Source MAC address: Facebook server's MAC address
        - Destination MAC address: Router-0's MAC address
2. **Router-0's Role**:
    - Router-0 receives the response packet from the Facebook server.
    - It checks its routing table and determines that the packet needs to be forwarded to Host device A, which is on the same LAN segment as Switch-1.
3. **Encapsulation by Router-0**:
    - Router-0 encapsulates the response packet with:
        - Source MAC address: Router-0's MAC address
        - Destination MAC address: Host device A's MAC address
    - This encapsulated packet is then forwarded to Switch-1.
4. **Switch-1 Forwarding**:
    - Switch-1 receives the encapsulated packet from Router-0 and forwards it to Host device A based on its MAC address.


- The response packet from the Facebook server initially has Router-0's MAC address as the destination MAC address because the packet was routed through Router-0.
- Router-0 modifies the packet by replacing the destination MAC address with Host device A's MAC address before forwarding it within the LAN.
- This ensures that the response packet reaches Host device A correctly, with the correct MAC address for direct delivery at the data link layer.
