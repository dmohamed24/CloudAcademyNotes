## ðŸ’¡ **Pro-Tips & Best Practices**

- **Use Auto Scaling and Load Balancers** for production â€” don't rely on a single EC2 instance.
- Always use **roles (IAM)** for EC2 to access AWS services â€” **never hardcode credentials**.
- Leverage **EC2 Instance Connect or SSM** for secure access without public IPs.
- **Backup critical EC2 instances regularly** using Snapshots or AMIs.
- Prefer **Elastic IPs only when necessary** â€” to avoid unnecessary IP allocation.
- Monitor **CPU credits for burstable instances (T2, T3)** to avoid throttling.
- Review and **right-size instances regularly** to optimize costs.
- Use **Tags for cost allocation and management** of EC2 resources.
