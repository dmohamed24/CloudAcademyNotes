### What is SQL database

SQL(relational) database is a collection of data that has pre-defined relationships between them. The collection of data is organized in table of rows and columns. The column represents a field of information that all the entities posses while a row holds all the formation that belongs to a single entity. 

A database schema _defines how data is organized within a relational database_

SQL databases follow the ACID model 

#### Features of relational database 
- **Primary Key:** This is a unique identifier for an entity in a single table  
- **Foreign Key:** This shows the relationship between tables by referencing the foreign key of another table
#### Advantages 
- **Structured Data:** Best suited for structured data with relationships.
- **ACID Compliance:** Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability of transactions.
- **Standardized Query Language:** SQL is a well-known and widely used language for querying and managing data.
- **Data Integrity:** Strong data integrity due to schema enforcement and constraints (e.g., foreign keys, unique constraints).

#### Disadvantages 
- **Scalability:** Vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) can be challenging and costly; horizontal scaling (distributing data across multiple servers) is complex.
- **Flexibility:** Less flexible when dealing with unstructured data or changing data requirements.
- **Complexity:** Schema design and management can be complex, especially for large datasets with many relationships.

#### When to use SQL databases

- **ACID Transactions:** When data integrity and consistency are critical.
- **Complex Queries:** When complex querying and reporting capabilities are required.
- **Structured Data:** When the data structure is well-defined and unlikely to change frequently.
- **Relational Data:** When relationships between data entities are important.


#### Examples

- **Financial Applications:** Banking systems where transaction accuracy and consistency are crucial.
- **E-commerce Websites:** Systems that require robust transaction management and relational data (e.g., product inventory, user orders).
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP):** Applications that manage business processes and rely on consistent and structured data.

#### N+1 QUERIES
In SQL databases, the N+1 query problem typically occurs when an application needs to load a parent entity along with its related child entities. For instance, consider a scenario where you have a list of authors and you want to fetch their books. If you first fetch the list of authors and then for each author fetch the list of books, you end up making one query to get the authors and N additional queries (one for each author) to get their books. This results in N+1 queries.
