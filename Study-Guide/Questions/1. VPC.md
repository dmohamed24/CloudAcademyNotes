## ðŸ’¡ **Bonus Pro-Tips to Remember**

- Use **small CIDR ranges** for testing and **large enough ranges** for production to prevent IP exhaustion.
- Prefer **NAT Gateways over NAT instances** for scalability and availability.
- **VPC Flow Logs + CloudWatch** = powerful combo for network monitoring.
- Design with **multi-AZ redundancy** for HA and fault tolerance.
- Avoid **VPC Peering sprawl** â€” use Transit Gateway for complex meshes.
- Use **AWS RAM and PrivateLink** to avoid unnecessary VPC peering in multi-account setups
