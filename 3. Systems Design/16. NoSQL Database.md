### What is NoSQL database 

Non-SQL databases are referred to as non relational databases because the data does not have a pre-defined schema to match. 

A database schemaÂ _defines how data is organized within a relational database_

#### Types of NoSQL databases 

##### 1. Document DB:
A document based db is a database that stores information in documents. Just like in a SQL table format the document is equivalent to the table, the collection are the rows and the attributes are the columns.  to The document is in a JSON format an array of objects. 

**Advantages:**
- Schema-less: Allows for flexible data modeling by storing data in JSON-like documents.
- Nested Documents: Supports complex hierarchical data structures.
- Easy to scale horizontally.

**Disadvantage:**
- Query Performance: Complex queries can be slower than in relational databases.
- Consistency: May not be strongly consistent by default.

**Use Cases**:
- Content Management Systems (CMS)
- E-commerce applications for product catalogs
- Blogging platforms

##### 2. Key-value Stores:
A key-value db is a database that stores information in a collection of a key value pair. In the data each key is unique and the corresponding value can be of any data type 

**Advantages:**
- High Performance: Very fast for read and write operations.
- Simple Data Model: Easy to implement and use.
- Scalable: Can handle large amounts of data and traffic.

**Disadvantage:**
- Limited Query Capabilities: Not suitable for complex queries.
- Data Modeling: Simple key-value structure may not be suitable for complex data relationships.

**Use Cases**:
- Caching
- Session management
- Real-time analytics

##### 3. Wide Column: 
Wide column db stores data in to columns rather than rows like in a traditional relational table. Data is stored in column families, which are collections of rows. Each row can have a different number of columns, and columns within a row can be added dynamically.

For Example a column that keeps the personal information of users will have a collection of multiple rows associated to it like First name, Last name, DOB, Address etc and these values can be of any data type . And the row will have the ID 

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility**: You can add new attributes (columns) to any column family without altering the existing schema. For instance, you can add a new column `PhoneNumber` to the `Personal Details` column family without affecting existing data.
- **Sparse Storage**: Only the columns that have data are stored. If a user does not have a `NextOfKin` value, that column will not be stored for that row, saving space.
- **Performance**: Since data is grouped by column families, reading or writing a subset of columns can be more efficient. For example, if you only need to access login information, you can read from the `Login Info` column family without fetching the entire row..
- **Efficient Reads and Writes**: Optimized for high write and read throughput.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of data and scale out easily across multiple servers.
- **Flexible Schema**: Allows for easy addition of new columns, making it adaptable to changing data requirements.
- **High Availability**: Typically supports replication and partitioning, ensuring data is available even in the event of hardware failures.

**Disadvantage:**
- **Complex Data Modeling**: Requires a good understanding of data access patterns to design efficient schemas.
- **Consistency**: Often follows eventual consistency models, which may not be suitable for all applications.
- **Limited Query Capabilities**: Not as powerful for complex queries compared to traditional SQL databases..

**Use Cases**:
- **Time-Series Data**: Ideal for storing and querying time-series data, such as logs, metrics, and sensor data.
- **Big Data Applications**: Suitable for applications that require storage and analysis of large volumes of data, such as data warehousing and analytics.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Used in applications that require fast write and read operations, such as recommendation engines and fraud detection systems.
- **Content Management Systems**: Can be used for storing and managing large volumes of semi-structured content.

##### 4. Graph database:
Graph databases are designed in a graph format. A data are represented as a nodes/entities and edges which defines the relationship between the entities. This structure makes graph databases particularly powerful for applications that require understanding and querying complex relationships between data points.

**Key Features**
- **Nodes**: Represent entities such as people, places, things, or events.
- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes, such as "friend of," "bought," "located in," etc.
- **Properties**: Nodes and edges can have properties (key-value pairs) to store additional information.
- **Traversal**: Queries often involve traversing through nodes via edges, making graph databases highly efficient for relationship-based queries.


**Advantages:**
- **Efficient Relationship Handling**: Optimized for querying and traversing complex relationships, which can be cumbersome in traditional relational databases.
- **Flexible Schema**: Schema-less or dynamic schema allows for easy addition of new types of nodes and relationships.
- **Performance**: Performs well with queries involving multiple hops or deep relationships.
- **Intuitive Data Modeling**: More natural representation of real-world relationships, making it easier to model and understand complex data.

**Disadvantage:**
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of graph theory and data modeling.
- **Scalability**: Can be challenging to scale horizontally compared to other NoSQL types, although modern graph databases are improving in this area.
- **Query Language**: May require learning new query languages such as Cypher (Neo4j) or Gremlin (Apache TinkerPop).

**Use Cases**:
- **Social Networks**: Representing users and their relationships (friends, followers).
- **Recommendation Engines**: Suggesting products, content, or friends based on user behavior and connections.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns and relationships between entities.
- **Network and IT Operations**: Managing and querying network configurations, dependencies, and impact analysis.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Storing and querying large amounts of interrelated information, such as in search engines and AI applications


##### 5. Time series:
Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, typically at uniform intervals. This type of data is used to track changes over time and is crucial for analyzing trends, patterns, and seasonal variations in various fields such as finance, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and more.

**Key Features**
- **Temporal Ordering**: Each data point is associated with a specific timestamp, and the order of data points is critical.
- **Regular Intervals**: Data points are often collected at regular intervals (e.g., every minute, hour, day), although irregular intervals are also possible.
- **Trend Analysis**: Time series data is often used to analyze trends and patterns over time.
- **Seasonality**: This data can exhibit seasonal patterns that repeat at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).


**Advantages:**
- **Trend Identification**: Helps in identifying trends and patterns over time.
- **Forecasting**: Enables predictive analytics for future values based on historical data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Useful for detecting outliers or abnormal behavior in the data.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Allows for continuous monitoring and assessment of systems or processes.

**Disadvantage:**
- **Large Volume**: Can generate large volumes of data, especially at high frequencies.
- **Complexity**: Requires specialized tools and techniques for analysis and modeling.
- **Storage and Retrieval**: Efficient storage and fast retrieval can be challenging, necessitating specialized databases.

**Use Cases**:
- **Finance**: Analyzing stock market trends, forecasting prices, and detecting fraudulent activities.
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient vital signs over time, such as heart rate and blood pressure.
- **Manufacturing**: Tracking machine performance and maintenance schedules.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Recording climate data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- **Energy**: Monitoring electricity consumption patterns and predicting future usage.

####  NO SQL Advantages 
- **Structured Data:** Best suited for structured data with relationships.
- **ACID Compliance:** Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability of transactions.
- **Standardized Query Language:** SQL is a well-known and widely used language for querying and managing data.
- **Data Integrity:** Strong data integrity due to schema enforcement and constraints (e.g., foreign keys, unique constraints).

#### NO SQL Disadvantages 
- **Scalability:** Vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) can be challenging and costly; horizontal scaling (distributing data across multiple servers) is complex.
- **Flexibility:** Less flexible when dealing with unstructured data or changing data requirements.
- **Complexity:** Schema design and management can be complex, especially for large datasets with many relationships.


#### N+1 QUERIES
In SQL databases, the N+1 query problem typically occurs when an application needs to load a parent entity along with its related child entities. For instance, consider a scenario where you have a list of authors and you want to fetch their books. If you first fetch the list of authors and then for each author fetch the list of books, you end up making one query to get the authors and N additional queries (one for each author) to get their books. This results in N+1 queries.
