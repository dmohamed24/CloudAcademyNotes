### Indexes in Databases

**Definition**: Indexes in databases are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional storage space and slower write operations. They function similarly to the index in a book, allowing the database to find the location of a particular row much faster than scanning the entire table.

### Benefits of Indexes

- **Speed Up Queries**: Indexes significantly improve the performance of read operations, such as SELECT queries.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Allows the database to quickly locate and access the rows in a table.
- **Reduced I/O Operations**: Minimizes the amount of data the database needs to scan, leading to reduced I/O operations.

### Types of Indexes

#### 1. **Primary Index**

- **Description**: Created on the primary key of a table.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Automatically unique.
    - Usually clustered, meaning the physical order of the data in the table matches the index.
- **Use Cases**: Identifying unique rows in a table.

##### Example:
```
EmployeeID  | LastName  | FirstName | Department | Salary
----------------------------------------------------------
1           | Smith     | John      | HR         | 60000
2           | Johnson   | Alice     | IT         | 75000
3           | Williams  | Robert    | Finance    | 50000
```

#### 2. **Secondary Index**

- **Description**: Created on non-primary key columns to improve query performance.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Can be unique or non-unique.
    - Can be clustered or non-clustered.
- **Use Cases**: Improving the performance of queries that filter or sort by non-primary key columns.
##### Example:
- Suppose we create a secondary index on the `LastName` column.
- This index allows for quick lookups by `LastName`.

```
LastName  | EmployeeID
-----------------------
Johnson   | 2
Smith     | 1
Williams  | 3
```
#### 3. **Dense Index**

- **Description**: Contains an entry for every search key value in the data file.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Each index entry points to a single record in the data file.
    - Provides quick access to any record in the file.
- **Advantages**: Faster lookups as every key has a direct reference.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires more storage space.
- **Use Cases**: Situations where fast query performance is critical and storage space is not a constraint.

##### Example:
- In a dense index, every search key value has an index entry.
- Dense index on `EmployeeID`
- Every `EmployeeID` has a corresponding pointer to its record in the table.

```
EmployeeID  | Pointer to Record
-------------------------------
1           | Record 1
2           | Record 2
3           | Record 3
```

#### 4. **Sparse Index**

- **Description**: Contains index entries only for some of the search key values.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Each entry points to a block of records.
    - Not every record has a corresponding index entry.
- **Advantages**: Requires less storage space compared to dense indexes.
- **Disadvantages**: Lookups can be slower because additional steps may be needed to locate the desired record.
- **Use Cases**: Large datasets where the cost of storage is a concern, and where full table scans are infrequent.

##### Example:
- In a sparse index, index entries exist only for some search key values.
- Sparse index on `EmployeeID`
- Here, the index entry points to blocks of records. The exact record within the block must be located by scanning the block.

```
EmployeeID  | Pointer to Block
------------------------------
1           | Block 1
3           | Block 2
```
#### 5. **Clustered Index**

- **Description**: Sorts the data rows in the table based on the index key.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Only one clustered index can be created on a table.
    - The physical order of the data matches the index order.
- **Advantages**: Fast data retrieval for queries that require sorting or range searches.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower insert, update, and delete operations due to the need to maintain the order.
- **Use Cases**: Tables that require frequent sorting or range queries.

##### Example:
- Suppose the `EmployeeID` is used as a clustered index.
- The table data is physically ordered by `EmployeeID`.
- This means the rows are stored on disk in the same order as the `EmployeeID`.
- **Table Data**: The rows in the table are now stored in the order of `EmployeeID`.
- **Physical Storage**: The physical storage of the data on disk matches the order of the `EmployeeID` column.

```
EmployeeID  | LastName  | FirstName | Department | Salary
----------------------------------------------------------
1           | Smith     | John      | HR         | 60000
2           | Johnson   | Alice     | IT         | 75000
3           | Williams  | Robert    | Finance    | 50000
```
#### 6. **Non-Clustered Index**

- **Description**: Does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains a separate structure for index data.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Multiple non-clustered indexes can be created on a table.
    - Points to the data in the table rather than sorting it.
- **Advantages**: Flexible, can speed up queries involving columns not in the clustered index.
- **Disadvantages**: Extra storage space required and potential performance hit on write operations.
- **Use Cases**: Queries that involve searching, filtering, or sorting on non-primary key columns.

##### Example:
- Suppose we create a non-clustered index on the `Department` column.
- Non-clustered index on `Department`:
- The index points to the `EmployeeID` but the physical order of the table is not changed.

```
Department | EmployeeID
-----------------------
Finance    | 3
HR         | 1
IT         | 2
```
