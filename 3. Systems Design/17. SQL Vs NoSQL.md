### Detailed Explanation

#### SQL Databases

- **Storage**: Data is stored in structured tables consisting of rows and columns.
- **Schema**: A predefined and rigid schema that defines the structure of data before it is stored. Changes to the schema require migration operations.
- **Querying**: Uses SQL for querying, which is powerful and allows for complex joins, aggregations, and transactions.
- **Scalability**: Primarily scales vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server. Some SQL databases offer horizontal scaling but it is complex.
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance ensures strong consistency and reliability of transactions.
- **Advantages**: Well-suited for structured data, strong consistency, and complex queries.
- **Disadvantages**: Less flexibility in schema design, challenging horizontal scalability, and potential performance issues with very large datasets.
- **Use Cases**: Financial systems, enterprise applications, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and applications requiring complex transactions.
- **Reasons for Using**: When strong consistency, structured data, and the need for complex querying are paramount.

#### NoSQL Databases

- **Storage**: Uses various models like document (JSON), key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases.
- **Schema**: Schema-less or dynamic schema allowing for flexible and evolving data structures.
- **Querying**: Varies by type; each NoSQL database has its own query language or API. Examples include MongoDB's JSON-like query language, Cassandra's CQL, and Neo4j's Cypher.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, making it suitable for big data applications.
- **Reliability**: Often follows the CAP theorem where a balance between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance is chosen. Many NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency.
- **Advantages**: High scalability, flexibility in handling various data types, and high performance for large volumes of data.
- **Disadvantages**: Weaker consistency guarantees (in some databases), complex queries can be harder to perform, and a less mature ecosystem for certain NoSQL types.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time analytics, IoT applications, content management, social networks, and recommendation engines.
- **Reasons for Using**: When high scalability, flexibility, and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data are required. Ideal for applications needing fast reads/writes and real-time processing.
