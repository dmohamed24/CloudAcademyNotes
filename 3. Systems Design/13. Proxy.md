A proxy server acts like an intermediary for either a client or a website server. 

### Forward Proxy 

A forward proxy is an intermediary server that sits between the client and the internet. It forwards the clients requests to the internet and then sends back the corresponding response it receives from the targeted servers 

#### Advantages 
- **Access Control:** Can be used to control, block and filter client access to the internet.
	- Enforcing internet usage policies in a corporate environment
	- Allows access to geo restricted content
	- Avoid other browsing restrictions
- **Caching:**  Cache responses to reduce bandwidth usage and improve response times for frequently accessed resources.
- **Security:** Hiding internal network details and providing an additional layer of security.

#### Disadvantage 
Although proxies provide the benefits of anonymity, they can still track our personal information. Setup and maintenance of a proxy server can be costly and requires configurations.

#### Examples
- **Corporate Proxy Servers:** Used in corporate networks to control and monitor employees' internet usage.
- **Content Filtering:** Proxies used in schools or organizations to filter and block access to inappropriate content.
- **Anonymizing Proxies:** Used to hide a user’s IP address and access resources anonymously.


### Reverse Proxy 

A reverse proxy is an intermediary server that sits between the backed server and the client on the internet. It forwards the clients requests to the correct backend server and then sends back the corresponding response it receives from the targeted servers to the client. 

#### Advantages 
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to balance load.
- **Caching:**  Can cache responses to improve performance and reduce load on backend servers
- **Security:** Hides the details of the backend servers and can provide SSL termination.

#### Disadvantage 
-  A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (i.e. a failover) further increases complexity.
#### Examples
- **Load Balancers:** Distribute requests among multiple servers to balance the load (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).
- **CDNs:** Cache content and serve it from locations closer to the client to reduce latency (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).
- **SSL Termination:** Handle SSL encryption/decryption to offload the task from backend servers.

### Comparison: Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy

| Aspect               | Forward Proxy                                        | Reverse Proxy                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Acts On Behalf Of    | Client                                               | Server                                           |
| Primary Function     | Forwarding client requests to external servers       | Forwarding client requests to backend servers    |
| Use Case             | Access control, anonymity, content filtering         | Load balancing, security, caching                |
| Position in Network  | Between client and the internet                      | Between the internet and backend servers         |
| Example Technologies | Squid, Privoxy, WinGate                              | NGINX, HAProxy, Cloudflare                       |
| Common Users         | Corporations, schools, individuals seeking anonymity | Web service providers, content delivery networks |
