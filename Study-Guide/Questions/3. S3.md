- What are the different S3 storage classes, and what use cases do they support?
    - Standard
    - Intelligent-Tiering
    - Standard-IA
    - One Zone-IA
    - Glacier
    - Glacier Deep Archive
- What are the durability, availability, and cost differences between storage classes?
- How can objects transition between storage classes automatically?

## âœ… **4. Security and Access Control**

- How do bucket policies and IAM policies work to control access to S3 buckets?
- What are ACLs (Access Control Lists), and when should they be used?
- What is Block Public Access (BPA), and how does it protect S3 buckets?
- What are S3 Access Points, and why would you use them?

## âœ… **5. Versioning and Object Lifecycle**

- What is versioning in S3, and why would you enable it?
- How does S3 handle deletes and overwrites when versioning is enabled?
- What is an object lock, and how does it support compliance and retention?
- How do lifecycle policies work to manage data aging and cost optimization?
- What actions can you automate with lifecycle rules (e.g., transition, expiration)?

---

## âœ… **6. Data Protection and Replication**

- What is Cross-Region Replication (CRR), and when would you use it?
- What is Same-Region Replication (SRR), and what are typical use cases?
- How is replication configured and monitored in S3?
