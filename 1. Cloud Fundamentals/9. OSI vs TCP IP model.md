Understanding the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is foundational to comprehending how networks operate. Let's break down each:

### OSI Model:

1. **Seven Layers**: The OSI model conceptualizes network communication into seven distinct layers, each with its own specific functions.
    - **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Provides interfaces for applications to access network services like HTTP, FTP, SMTP and initiate the commination between devices 
    - **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: This layer is primarily responsible for preparing the data so that i can be consumed by the application layer which involves,  data translation, encryption, and compression. Communicating devices may use different encoding methods so this layer translates and formats the incoming data in syntax the app layer understands and expects. If an encrypted connection is used this layer will either add the encryption or decrypt the data depending on the receiving or sending party of the data. Lastly this layer also compresses data it receives from the application layer to help with speed and efficiency 
    - **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Manages communication sessions between devices, including session establishment, maintenance, and termination. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources. The TCP three-way handshake involves the following three steps: **synchronize (SYN), synchronize-acknowledge (SYN-ACK), and acknowledge (ACK)**
    - **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Facilitates end-to-end communication, ensuring data reliability and error recovery through protocols like TCP(reliable) and UDP(unreliable). This layer is responsible for end to end communication between 2 devices. This includes breaking the data from the session layer into chunks called segments. The layer is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control involves determining an optimal speed of transmission. The error control is performed on the receiving device ensuring that the data received is complete, and requesting a retransmission if it isn’t. The protocols include TCP & UDP *SEGMENTS*
    - **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: . This layer is responsible for facilitating data between devices on different networks using routers and IP address. This also breaks down the data segments into smaller units called packets on the senders device and reassembles these packets on the receivers device.    *PACKETS* 
    - **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**:  This layer facilitates data transfer between 2 devices on the same network using Mac address and switches. This layer also breaks down the data packets in to smaller pieces called frames. Its also responsible for flow control, managing physical addressing and error detection. *FRAME*
    - **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Deals with the physical equipment required for data transfer over the network medium such as cables , electrical, optical, or wireless signals. At this layer the data gets transformed in to a bit stream which is a string of 1s & 0s.  *BITS*
#### **PLEASE DO NOT THROW SAUSAGE PIZZA AWAY***

In the OSI model, the direction of data travel depends on whether data is being sent or received by a device. Here’s how it works:

### Data Transmission (Sending Data)

When data is being sent from a device, it travels from the top layer (Application Layer) down to the bottom layer (Physical Layer):

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The application generates data.
2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Data is formatted, encrypted, and/or compressed.
3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: A session is established, maintained, and terminated
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Data is segmented, and reliable transmission is ensured (e.g., using TCP).
5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Logical addressing and routing are applied.
6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Data is framed and MAC addresses are added.
7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Data is converted to signals (electrical, optical, or radio) for transmission over the physical medium.

### Data Reception (Receiving Data)

When data is being received by a device, it travels from the bottom layer (Physical Layer) up to the top layer (Application Layer):

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Signals are received and converted to bits.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Frames are checked for errors and MAC addresses are used for local addressing.
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Packets are routed using IP addresses.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Segments are reassembled, and reliable transmission is verified.
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Sessions are managed and maintained.
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Data is decrypted, decompressed, and formatted.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The application processes the received data.


### TCP/IP Model:

1. **Four Layers**: The TCP/IP model simplifies network communication into four layers, closely aligned with the practical implementation of the Internet.
    - **Application Layer**: Corresponds roughly to the OSI application, presentation, and session layers. Includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
    - **Transport Layer**: Similar to OSI transport layer. Provides reliable, end-to-end data transmission. TCP ensures reliable delivery, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication.
    - **Internet Layer**: Equivalent to the OSI network layer. Handles IP addressing, routing, and packet forwarding. Includes the Internet Protocol (IP) and routing protocols like ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
    - **Link Layer**: Combines functionalities of OSI data link and physical layers. Deals with data framing, error detection, and physical transmission. Includes protocols like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP.

### Relationship:

- The TCP/IP model is a practical implementation of networking protocols used on the Internet, while the OSI model is a conceptual framework.
- The TCP/IP model's application layer encompasses functions distributed across the OSI application, presentation, and session layers.
- Both models help in understanding network communication, troubleshooting, and designing networks, though the OSI model offers a more detailed conceptualization.

The OSI model provides a structured, theoretical framework that goes from hardware to applications, while TCP/IP, with its four layers, is all about practicality and closely aligns with real-world protocols. Great illustration
