- **Definition:** A switch is a network device that connects devices within a local area network (LAN), forwarding data packets between devices based on MAC addresses. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- **Functionality:** Switches create a network infrastructure by connecting devices (such as computers, printers, and servers) within a LAN, allowing them to communicate directly with each other.
- **Examples:** Ethernet switches, managed switches, and network switches used in office or home networks.

### How it Works 
Scenario: Host device A communicating with Host device B in a local area network via a Switch.  There is 2 main steps to this process 

##### 1. Address Resolution Protocol
1. **Initiation**: Host device A wants to communicate with host device B and knows B's IP address but not its MAC address.
2. **ARP Request Creation**: Device A creates an ARP request packet. This packet includes:
    - Source MAC address (A's MAC address)
    - Source IP address (A's IP address)
    - Target IP address (B's IP address)
    - Target MAC address (set to all zeros initially)
3. **ARP Request Broadcast**: Device A broadcasts the ARP request to all devices in the local network segment. The switch receives this broadcast and forwards it to all ports except the one it was received from.
4. **Receiving the ARP Request**: All devices on the network receive the ARP request, but only the device with the matching IP address (device B) processes it.
5. **ARP Reply Creation**: Device B recognizes its IP address in the ARP request and creates an ARP reply. This packet includes:
    - Source MAC address (B's MAC address)
    - Source IP address (B's IP address)
    - Target IP address (A's IP address)
    - Target MAC address (A's MAC address)
6. **ARP Reply Unicast**: Device B sends the ARP reply directly to device A using unicast. The switch receives this packet and forwards it to device A.
7. **Updating ARP Table**: Upon receiving the ARP reply, device A updates its ARP table with device B's MAC address associated with its IP address.
8. **Communication**: With the MAC address known, device A can now send data packets directly to device B using the switch to forward packets based on MAC addresses.


##### 2. Flooding
1. **Device Communication via Switch**:
    - A device (Host A) sends a data frame to another device (Host B) through the switch.
    - The frame contains the source and destination MAC addresses.
2. **Switch Forwarding Decision Process**:
    - **MAC Address Learning**:
        - The switch receives the frame on a specific port.
        - It reads the source MAC address and records it in the Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table along with the incoming port number.
    - **CAM Table Lookup**:
        - The switch looks up the destination MAC address in the CAM table.
        - If the destination MAC address is found, the switch forwards the frame to the corresponding port.
        - If the destination MAC address is not found (unknown address), the switch floods the frame to all ports except the source port.
    - **Frame Forwarding**:
        - The frame is sent to the port associated with the destination MAC address.
        - Host B receives the frame and processes it.
3. **CAM Table Update**:
    - The switch continuously updates the CAM table as it learns new MAC addresses and their corresponding ports.

#### Unknown Destination MAC Address Handling

- **Unknown MAC Address**:
    - When a switch receives a data frame, it checks the destination MAC address against its Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table to find the associated port.
    - If the destination MAC address is not in the CAM table, the switch considers it an unknown address.
- **Flooding Mechanism**:
    - **Flooding**: To ensure the frame reaches the intended recipient, the switch forwards (floods) the frame out of all ports except the port on which it was received.
    - **Purpose**: This process ensures that the frame reaches its destination if the destination device is connected to any port on the switch. Once the destination device receives the frame, it will respond, and the switch will learn the destination MAC address and update its CAM table.
- **Subsequent Communication**:
    - After flooding and receiving a response, the switch learns the destination MAC address and records it in the CAM table along with the associated port.
    - Future frames destined for the same MAC address can now be forwarded directly to the correct port, eliminating the need for flooding.

### Example Scenario:

1. **Initial Frame**:
    - Host A sends a frame to Host B. The switch receives this frame on Port 1.
    - The switch learns Host A's MAC address and associates it with Port 1 in the CAM table.
2. **Unknown Destination**:
    - The switch checks the destination MAC address (Host B's MAC) in its CAM table.
    - Host B's MAC address is not found (unknown).
3. **Flooding**:
    - The switch floods the frame out of all other ports (e.g., Ports 2, 3, 4, etc.) except Port 1.
    - All connected devices receive the frame, but only Host B, the intended recipient, processes it.
4. **Response and Learning**:
    - Host B responds to Host A. The switch receives this response on Port 3.
    - The switch learns Host B's MAC address and associates it with Port 3 in the CAM table.
5. **Subsequent Frames**:
    - Any future frames from Host A to Host B (or vice versa) are now directly forwarded to the correct port without flooding.
