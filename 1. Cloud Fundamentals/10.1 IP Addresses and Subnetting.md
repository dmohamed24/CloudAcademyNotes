### What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It allows devices to send and receive data over the internet and other networks. 

Ip addresses server to main functionalities, host/network interface identification and  location addressing 

### How it works
- When a device connects to a network, the router assigns it an IP address.
- A subnet mask with an octet of 255 means the corresponding IP address octet is fixed; an octet of 0 means the corresponding IP address octet can range from 0 to 255.
- Example: For a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the IP address range is 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.
- The static part (e.g., 192.168.1) is the network portion, and the dynamic part (0-255) is the host portion.
- A router can assign 253 IP addresses within a network. Three addresses are reserved: 192.168.1.0 (network address), 192.168.1.255 (broadcast address), and the routerâ€™s IP, typically 192.168.1.1.

### Real World Example

If Allan, living at 5 Markstan Street, wants to send a gift to his friend at 13 Markstan Street, he can walk over and deliver it directly. Similarly, devices on the same network (e.g., 192.168.1.x) can communicate directly with each other.

However, if Allan wants to send a gift to a friend on a different street, he needs a delivery man. Similarly, if a device needs to communicate with another device on a different network (e.g., 192.168.1.x and 132.124.4.x), it requires a router (default gateway) to facilitate the connection.

### IP (v4) addresses 
**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** Uses a 32-bit address format, consisting of four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It supports approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

- **Excessive Unusable IP Addresses**:
    - IPv4 includes a significant number of reserved or special-purpose addresses that cannot be used for regular host assignments. These include:
        - **Private IP Ranges**: (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) reserved for internal network use, not routable on the public internet.
        - **Loopback Addresses**: (127.0.0.0/8) used for diagnostics and testing on the local machine which means 16 million IP addresses restricted for this use case when only 1 is technically required. `ping 127.0.0.1`
        - **Link-local Addresses**: (169.254.0.0/16) used for auto-configuration when no DHCP server is available.
        - **Multicast Addresses**: (224.0.0.0/4) reserved for multicast traffic.
        - **Broadcast Addresses**: Used to send data to all devices on a network segment.
    - These reserved ranges reduce the pool of available public IP addresses.
- **Over-allocation of IP Addresses by IANA**:
    - IANA allocated large blocks of IP addresses in the early days of the internet, leading to inefficient usage and depletion of address space.
    - **Class A Allocations**: Large organizations received Class A blocks (16 million addresses per block), often using only a fraction of them.
    - **Class B Allocations**: Mid-sized organizations received Class B blocks (65,536 addresses per block), also often underutilized.
    - This allocation method contributed to rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, prompting the development and deployment of IPv6.

### Private Network 
- Private networks were created to allow devices to connect to the internet using reserved IP address ranges that are not routable on the public internet. These addresses include ranges such as `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`
 - Many home and private networks commonly use the `192.168.1.x` subnet for internal IP addressing.
- **Connecting Private Networks to the Internet**:
    - Devices in a private network cannot directly connect to or access the internet because private IP addresses are not routable on public networks e.g internet
    - In order to facilitate internet access, the ISP (internet) provides of the home router with a unique public IP address (e.g., `13.54.5.111`).
- **Role of the Router and NAT**:
    - The router uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to map private IP addresses to the public IP address assigned by the ISP
    - NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for internet access.
- **How NAT Works**:
    - When a device on the private network to make a request or access the internet, the router translates the private IP address to its public IP address provided by ISP
    - The router keeps track of each session so that incoming responses from the internet are correctly routed back to the requesting device.
    - This process allows a single public IP address to handle multiple simultaneous connections from different devices on the private network.
- **Benefits of NAT**:
    - NAT significantly reduces the number of public IP addresses required, alleviating the IPv4 address exhaustion issue.
    - By using NAT, millions of devices can connect to the internet through a limited number of public IP addresses.

In summary, private networks and NAT enable efficient use of limited IPv4 addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address for internet connectivity. This system helps mitigate the scarcity of public IPv4 addresses.

### IPV6

- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** Uses a 128-bit address format, consisting of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). It supports a vastly larger number of unique addresses.
- The number of ipv6 addresses is 2^128
- Ipv6 addresses the limitations of IPv4 and provides enhanced features like improved routing and security
