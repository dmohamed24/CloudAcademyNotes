# Let me level you up (important question)

Are you learning testing:

- For job readiness?
    
- Or just curiosity?
    

Because if you want, next I can show you something **MOST juniors never learn properly**:

### Testing async + API calls + loading states (VERY REAL WORLD)

Or…

I can turn this into a **real professional test suite** with best practices (describe blocks, setup functions, etc).
