### What is a CDN 
Its is a group of servers distributed in different geographical locations that work together to help provide faster delivery of content across the internet.

CDN's increase the availability and redundancy of the served content while reducing the bandwidth cost and improving security

Serving content through a CDN increases the performance of the system and user experience as the user receives the requested content from a nearby server instead of the original source server which could be located on the other side of the world which would make take a much longer time serving the data 

### How CDN work
#### Handling user requests 

1. When a user requests a content the CDN routes the request to the nearest edge location server 
2. If the requested content is cached and available in that edge server it will be delivered to the user (cache hit)
3. If the requested content is not cached in the edge server (cache miss) then the edge server will fetch that content from the origin server and then cache it and delivery the content to the user

#### Content type 
1. Static content: This is content that does not change regardless from user to user i.e fonts, logos, images, text etc. So using a CDN for content that is universal to all users and does not change makes sense to store in a CDN for quick easy access 
2. Dynamic content: These type of content changers depending on the users personal preferences i.e news feed, for you page, chat messages etc. Using a CDN for this does have the same benefits as for static content but it does introduce complexities in configuration and cache management as well as potential higher costs 

#### Content distribution 
1. The content from the origin server is replicated and distributed across all the edge servers located across the globe
2. This will ensure high availability and redundancy

#### Load balancing 
1. CDNs use load balancing to handle and distribute the user requests between edge servers in a location so that no single server is over worked and if a server is down the requests are re-routed to other stable and available servers. This maintains performance during a during hugh traffic

### Types of CDN 

#### Push CDN: 
In a push CDN, content is manually or via a automated script is uploaded or "pushed" to the CDN's edge servers by the content owner. The content is proactively distributed to various edge locations before any user requests. 

**Advantages**
- **Control:** Provides more control over when and what content is distributed to edge servers.
- **Preloaded Content:** Ensures that content is already available at the edge servers before users request it, which can be beneficial for expected high-traffic events.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Management Overhead:** Requires manual intervention or automated scripts to keep the edge servers updated with the latest content.
- **Storage Costs:** Can incur higher storage costs as content is stored on multiple edge servers, whether it's frequently accessed or not.

**Use Cases:**
- **Live Events:** Preloading videos, images, or other content for a live event or a product launch where high traffic is anticipated.
- **Large Static Files:** Distributing large static files like software downloads or game updates that users are expected to download frequently.

#### Pull CDN: 
In a pull CDN, content is automatically fetched or "pulled" from the origin server to the CDN's edge servers when a user requests it for the first time. Subsequent requests for the same content are served from the edge cache.

**Advantages:**
- **Automatic Caching:** Reduces the need for manual content management since the CDN automatically fetches and caches content as needed.
- **Efficient Storage:** Only frequently accessed content is cached, optimizing storage usage on edge servers.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Initial Latency:** The first request for a piece of content can have higher latency as it involves fetching from the origin server.
- **Cache Miss:** If content is not requested frequently, it may not be cached and always fetched from the origin, potentially leading to higher latency for those requests.

**Use Cases:**
- **Websites with Dynamic Content:** Ideal for websites where the content changes frequently or is user-specific (e.g., personalized web pages, user-generated content).
- **General Web Content:** Suitable for serving a wide variety of content types where caching needs to be automatic and efficient.

### Comparison of Push CDN and Pull CDN

|Aspect|Push CDN|Pull CDN|
|---|---|---|
|Content Distribution|Proactively pushed to edge servers|Pulled on-demand from origin servers|
|Control|High control over content distribution|Less control, content is cached as requested|
|Initial Latency|No initial latency for cached content|Higher initial latency due to fetching from origin on first request|
|Storage Efficiency|May store unnecessary content|More efficient, only frequently accessed content is cached|
|Management Overhead|Higher, requires manual uploads or automation|Lower, automatic caching based on user requests|
|Best for|High-traffic events, large static files|Dynamic websites, diverse content needs|

**Push CDN Example:**

- A media company preloads upcoming episodes of a popular show to CDN edge servers to ensure that millions of viewers can stream the new episode without any delay when it becomes available.

**Pull CDN Example:**

- An e-commerce website uses a pull CDN to serve product images and pages. When a user requests a product page for the first time, the CDN fetches and caches the images and page content from the origin server. Subsequent users accessing the same product page get the content served quickly from the edge cache.

### Advantages of CDNs 

- **Improved Performance**
    - Reduced Latency: By serving content from geographically closer servers, CDNs minimize the time it takes for data to travel to the user.
    - Faster Load Times: Cached content is served quickly without needing to fetch it from the origin server each time.
- **High Availability and Reliability**
    - Redundancy: Multiple edge servers ensure that if one server goes down, others can continue to serve content.
    - Failover: Automatic rerouting of traffic to available servers in case of server failures.
- **Scalability**
    - Handling Traffic Spikes: CDNs can absorb and manage large volumes of traffic, especially during peak times or unexpected traffic surges.
    - Global Reach: CDNs can serve users across the globe efficiently, supporting a large number of concurrent users.
- **Security**
    - DDoS Mitigation: CDNs can absorb and mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by distributing the attack traffic across multiple servers.
    - Secure Content Delivery: Many CDNs offer features like SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure content delivery.
- **Cost Savings**
    - Reduced Bandwidth Costs: By caching content and serving it from edge servers, CDNs reduce the amount of data that needs to be delivered from the origin server, saving bandwidth costs.
    - Efficient Resource Utilization: Offloading traffic to CDNs allows origin servers to handle more complex tasks and reduces the need for additional infrastructure.

## Disadvantages of CDNs

- **Extra charges**: It can be expensive to use a CDN, especially for high-traffic services.
- **Restrictions**: Some organizations and countries have blocked the domains or IP addresses of popular CDNs.
- **Location**: If most of our audience is located in a country where the CDN has no servers, the data on our website may have to travel further than without using any CDN.
